# Data science events

NHS-R already has a very successful conference but in the workshop [there was a suggestion]({{<ref "docs/background/_index.md#what-can-the-nhs-r-community-do-to-support-the-system">}}) that there could be another NHS-R event focused on finding problems and solutions to them. There are several ways this could usefully be done, perhaps as a hackathon type approach where the problems are begun on during the event (finished during the event if there is time or worked on afterwards), or more of a problem definition/ alliance building type approach where the actual problems and the people who are interested in solving them are idenfied during the event and then the actual development is done later.
