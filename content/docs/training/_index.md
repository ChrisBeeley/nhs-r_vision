# Training

The NHS-R community has developed/ is developing training on introduction to R, Shiny, R Markdown, git, and interactive plotting, amongst other things. 

* Where are the gaps in training provision at the current time?
* How can NHS-R maintain/ increase the amount of training that it is able to deliver free to health and social care staff in the NHS in the UK?

# Development 

The NHS-R community comprises members with a very wide diversity of job roles and skills. Although there is no one route to being a skilled and userful R developer in health and social care nonetheless the R community could usefully contribute to thinking on how to recruit, train, and develop analysts who use R and other open code approaches to data science/ data analysis.
