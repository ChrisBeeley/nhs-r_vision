# Guidance

Adoption of open tooling and code is very variable across the different organisations from which NHS-R members are drawn- some organisations are fairly open to new approaches and allow the use of open tools like R and Python as well as the sharing of analytic code. Others are much more restrictive and it can be very difficult for some analysts to even install R.

NHS-R has a role in showing that these approaches are safe and appropriate within a health context, and in producing a set of guidelines around, e.g. use of git and GitHub, installation of CRAN packages, etc., to help IT teams and others allow their staff to use these tools with confidence.
